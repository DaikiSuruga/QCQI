\section{\Large Exercise 2.20:(Basis changes)}
Suppose $A'$ and $A''$ are matrix representations of an operator A on a vector space V
with respect to two different orthonormal bases, $\ket{v_i}$ and $\ket{w_i}$.
Then the elements of $A'$ and $A''$ are $A_{ij}' = \braket{v_i|A|v_j}$ and
$A_{ij}'' = \braket{w_i|A|w_j}$.
Characterize the relationship between $A'$ and $A''$.
